# Bamazon

A basic storefront CLI application that uses mySQL to store/edit inventory items which can be ordered by the user via the item id.

- Customer View
The user can choose to see the inventory and will be prompted to select an item using its ID.
Once an item is selected, the user will be prompted to select the quantity of the item.
Once the quantity is selected, it will be subtracted from the current quantity of that item.

If a user selects a quantity that is over what is available, the application will prompt the user to try again.
